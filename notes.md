## Math

1.37 billion km^3 is the volume of the world's oceans.

The conversion rate is equal to (size of screen)/volume.

Assuming that the screen has 400px, the approximate value of 1 pixel is 400 km^3.

This means that every day there are approximately 2 pixels plotted for the 940 km^3 of water polluted a day.

Assuming that water is never cleaned, and that all car washes are working at high capacity, it would take approximately 1457446 years for the world to be polluted entirely by car washes in the U.S. alone.
